# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 1)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.
> You are **required to author 3 of your own questions**.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

(These questions assume you are interviewing a festival attendee at the festival. If you didn't attend the festival, you may revise the questions and instead ask the participant to recall the last festival/event they attended. Do not ask them to speculate about visiting the Apple Harvest Festival. User speculation provides biased data.)

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. What brought you to visit the Apple Harvest Festival today?

3. Can you walk me through the process of you coming to the Apple Harvest festival today?

4. Have you previously been to the Apple Harvest festival?

5. What type of transportation did you take to come here today?

6. Did you use the Apple Harvest festival website today?
6a. If yes, what information were you seeking? Did you find it?

7. Have you been to a community event/festival like this in the past?
7a. If yes, what information did you need for those events/festivals?

8. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!

### Goals (Milestone 1)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 2).

Goal 1: Find out festival registration information

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Create a giant registration button that the audience can click to bring them to the registration information
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The main goal of a vendor at Apple Fest is to register to become a vendor, which is why placing emphasis on a large button in the middle of the website will make the process for finding registration information a lot easier

Goal 2: Register as a vendor for the festival

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The button when clicked should send the user to a clearly defined checklist that lists all of the steps necessary for the user to take to register as a vendor for the Apple Harvest festival
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Placing all of the required steps in a checklist makes the steps clearly defined for the audience to find when the information is all in one place, so they are less worried about missing a step or forgetting to do something that puts their registration in jeopardy, and it will also make their lives easier as they don't have to go hunting around the website to piece together what is needed to register

Goal 3: Finding additional important information about the fair (e.g. time, location, date)

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Have the additional important information split into different pages based on topic, so that the audience can easily search for other information they might find necessary as a vendor (e.g. put time, location, and date on the home page, directions on another page, sponsors on another page, and more about the apple fest on its own page)
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Sorting the additional, remaining information into its own pages keeps the pages less cluttered and overwhelming for the user, allowing them to search for the additional information they need at their own pace


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

The audience of my site are vendors looking to participate in the Apple Harvest festival. They are a cohesive group because they roughly have the same goal of selling things at the festival, and share the same goal of needing to register as a vendor for Apple fest which is not a goal that another audience, such as Ithaca residents interested in visiting the festival have.


## Festival/Event Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three festival or event websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://margaretvillecauliflowerfestival.org/>

    ![Margaretville Cauliflower Festival narrow view website](/design-plan/Margaretville-Cauliflower-Festival-Narrow.jpg)

    ![Margaretville Cauliflower Festival wide view website](/design-plan/Margaretville-Cauliflower-Festival-Wide.png)

2. <https://www.newenglandfarmandfiber.com/>

    ![New England Farm & Fiber Festival narrow view website](/design-plan/New-England-Farm-And-Fiber-Fest-Narrow.jpg)

    ![New England Farm & Fiber Festival wide view website](/design-plan/New-England-Farm-And-Fiber-Fest-Wide.png)

3. <https://eurekafiberintheozarks.com/>

    ![Eureka! Fiber in the Ozarks narrow view website](/design-plan/Eureka-Narrow.jpg)

    ![Eureka! Fiber in the Ozarks wide view website](/design-plan/Eureka-Wide.png)


### Festival/Event Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (2-3 sentences)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

The Margaretville Cauliflower Festival website's header is organized in the wide view with the website title and navigation bar on the same line. The main content has margins on both left and right sides, and there is a footer on the bottom of the page. In the narrow view of the website, the navigation menu is collapsed with the website title and navigation menu on different lines. The main content covers 100% of the width of the screen and there is also a footer. I like the header image that acts as decoration for the website as well as the way the header and main content scroll up with the banner image stationary which looks cool.


### Festival/Event Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (2-3 sentences)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

In the wide view of the New England Farm & Fiber Festival the website title and navigation bar are on the same line (although the navigation bar takes up two lines). Also, the main content is formatted in a two column style, and at the end of the site is a picture of sheep which I assume is there to act as the footer. In the narrow view the navigation menu is collapsed into a hamburger menu next to the website title. Instead of two columns, the main content is organized into one long, vertical column that takes up the full width of the screen. I really like how cohesive the images of the website and font look together. The color theme of the website also looks really nice.


### Festival/Event Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (2-3 sentences)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

In the wide view of the Eureka website, the header has a logo that is centered, with a navigation bar underneath. The main content takes up 100% of the width in most areas with a footer at the bottom. In the narrow view of the website, the navigation menu is condensed into a hamburger menu left-justified on the header and in-line with the website title. The main conent is the same as the wide view, just with all of the content scaled down and everything still 100% wide. I like how the color scheme stays consistent throughout the website.


## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)
> **Do not place the content directly in the design journey.** Simply list it here. \
> i.e. Provide a brief description of each piece of content you intend to include.

- 41st Annual Apple Harvest Festival text
- date text
- location text
- festival hours text
- We are excited to welcome you text
- This annual festival marks text
- entertainment location text
- entertainment schedule text
- directions & parking text
- vendors text
- list of vendors text
- history of festival text
- faq text
- vendor registration information text
- vendor sign up link text
- apple harvest logo image
- apple harvest map image
- cider apples stand image
- vendor stall image
- apple basket many image
- commons far image
- craft jewelry image
- sign vendor image


### Content Justification (Milestone 1)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

This content is the right content for my audience of vendors interested in participating in the Apple Harvest festival because it includes all the information that a vendor needs to sign up as a vendor. On top of that, there is information a vendor also might need to know, such as the date, time, and location of the event, as well as the entertainment schedule and locations, other vendors that will be vending, directions, and some frequently asked qeustions. This content addresses their goals of finding out vending registration information and applying as a vendor because it includes the content that is necessary to register as a vendor and the vendor sign up link. This content also helps them acheive their goal of finding other important information about the festival because the content provides this information to them. The images help support the text and add decoration to the website.


## Information Architecture (Milestone 1)

### Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 1 iteration of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Card sorting first iteration](/design-plan/Card-Sorting-1.jpg)
In this iteration I sorted each card by the content subject, putting everything related to vendors in one group, apple harvest fest general information in one group, maps and directions in a group, entertainment information in a group, and faq in its own group.

![Card sorting second iteration](/design-plan/Card-Sorting-2.jpg)
In this iteration I did mostly the same groups as the previous cardsort, except I split up the vendor information because it seemed like a lot on one page, and I felt that the list of vendors and the vendor text would make it harder for the vendors to find the vendor application and information if it was hidden by other content not as important. I also moved an image into the entertainment group because I felt like it needed more imagery since it used to consist only of text.


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I plan to use the second iteration of sorting.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

This organization makes sense for my audience of interested vendors for Apple fest because I have information sorted primarily by importance of information, and secondarily by the subject of the information. The most important information for my audience is information about registering as a vendor and the registration link, which were sorted into the same group. Then, the remaining, less imprtant information were sorted by subject into other vendor information, directions, general information, entertainment, and faq groups so that my audience can browse the remaining information based on subject, so they can find what they are looking for more efficiently.


### Navigation (Milestone 1)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Vendor Registration
- Vendors
- Entertainment
- Navigation
- FAQ

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

These names makes sense because they summarize the content in each group. The general information group is given the name home because it will be the home page. The vendor registration information is titled vendor registration to make it easy for vendors to find exactly where to register as a vendor. The list of vendors is titled vendors, and vendors and vendor registration are named differently so as not to confuse the user. The directions, parking, and map are all listed under navigation as an umbrella name to describe them all. The entertainment group and faq sections are named entertainment and faq because they accurately summarize the topics on these pages.

## Visual Theme (Milestone 1)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

- Simple, clean website
  - This website would have lots of straight edges and coherent colors with serif typography.
  - It would be appropriate for my target audience because it looks professional and would also help my audience find the information they need easier since there is not a lot of clutter on the website hiding the important content.
- Fun, chaotic website
  - This website would have lots of round edges and bright colors with san serif/cursive typography
  - This theme would be appropriate for my target audience because the vendors will be applying to sell at a festival, which are typically fun and loud. This theme would give off the same impression of entering a festival as the user enters the website.
- Rustic chic website
  - This website would have mostly straight edges with rustic, earth-toned colors and san serif typography.
  - This theme would be appropriate for my audience because many of the vendors are selling produce from farms or handmade crafts, which makes a rustic theme seem fitting to describe them.
I ended up choosing the rustic chic website because while all the themes would have been appropriate for my audience, I felt that the rustic chic theme would really embody the feeling of the Apple Harvest festival the best.

## Design (Milestone 1)

Document your site's layout.

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 1)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch **both** the **narrow** and **wide** versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Design layout 1](/design-plan/design-layout-1.jpg)
In this layout design, I designed the homepage with a header that includes the logo and website title on the same line, and a navigation bar below. In the narrow view version the main content is stacked on each other, taking 100% of the width of the screen while in the wide view version of this design there is a sidebar on the left that the supporting images go in, while the text content is in the main body section. Both narrow and wide views have footers at the end.

![Design layout 2](/design-plan/design-layout-2.jpg)
This layout design is similar to the first design, with a header that includes the logo and website title on the same line, and a navigation bar below. The main difference between the first and second design layout is that the header has an extra image banner below the navigation bar in the wide view and navigation menu in the narrow view. Aside from that, the layout stays pretty much the same.

I ended up sticking with the first layout because I felt that adding the extra image banner to the header buries the content and makes it harder for the audience to find the information they are looking for.


### Final Design (Milestone 1)
> Include the final sketches for **each** of your pages.
> Include both narrow and wide versions of each page.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch.


![Home page design sketch](/design-plan/home-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
In the narrow design of the home page, the logo and website title are at the top inline with each other. Below the header is the navigation menu. Underneath the navigation menu is the main content - a picture from the Apple Festival, along with the heading "41st Annual Harvest Fest" as the website page title, and the page's text underneath. At the bottom of the page is a footer.
**Wide Design:**
In the wide design of the home page, the logo and website title are at the top of the page inline with each other, and unlike the narrow design, there is a navigation bar below. Underneath the navigation bar are two columns - a sidebar to the left and main content to the right. The supporting image goes into the sidebar on the left while the page title and text goes in the main content. At the bottom is a footer.

![Vendor registration page design sketch](/design-plan/vendor-registration-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
In the narrow design of the vendor registration page, the header and navigation menu are the same as the home page. Below the navigation menu is the heading that reads "Vendor Registration" as the website page title, the page's text, and two supporting images underneath. At the bottom of the page is a footer.
**Wide Design:**
In the wide design of the vendor registration page, the header and nagivation bar are the same as the home page's. The formatting of the content is also the same, with two supporting images in the sidebar on the left, and the page title "Vendor Registration", the page's text, and a button that links to the vendor registration form on the right. At the bottom of the page is a footer.

![Vendors page design sketch](/design-plan/vendors-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
In the narrow design of the vendors page, the header and navigation menu are the same as the home page. Below the navigation menu is the heading that reads "Vendors" as the website page title, the list of vendors, and two supporting images underneath. At the bottom of the page is a footer.
**Wide Design:**
In the wide design of the vendors page, the header and nagivation bar are the same as the home page's. The formatting of the content is also the same, with two supporting images in the sidebar on the left, and on the right the page title "Vendors", and a list of vendors. At the bottom of the page is a footer.

![Entertainment page design sketch](/design-plan/entertainment-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
The narrow design of the entertainment page has the same layout as the home page, just with the heading "Entertainment" and a list of entertainment as the main content.
**Wide Design:**
The wide design of the entertainment page is also designed the same as the home page, except it has the page title "Entertainment", and a list of entertainment as the main content.

![Navigation page design sketch](/design-plan/navigation-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
The narrow design of the navigation page has the same layout as the home page, just with the heading "Directions & Parking", the page's text, and a map of the festival.
**Wide Design:**
The wide design of the navigation page is also designed the same as the home page's, except it has the page title "Directions & Parking", and in the sidebar is a map of the festival rather than simply a supporting image.

![FAQ page design sketch](/design-plan/faq-design-sketch.jpg)
**Narrow Design:**
In the narrow design of the frequently asked questions page, the header and navigation menu are the same as the home page. Below the navigation menu is the heading that reads "FAQ" as the website page title, and the questions followed by their answers are listed below.
**Wide Design:**
In the wide design of the vendor registration page, the header and nagivation bar are the same as the home page's. The formatting of the content is also the same, with a sidebar on the left and space for main content on the right. The sidebar for this page is empty, and on the right the page title "FAQ", and the list of questions and answeres are found.


### Design Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

The design of my website meets the goals of my audience of vendors interested in participating in the Apple Harvest festival because it is sorted in a way that makes finding information they need efficient. The information that they need the most - for vendor registration is put all on its own page, making it easy for my audience to find information about becoming a vendor and registering. Additionally, the other information (such as directions, entertainment info, time and date) that they might possibly need is sorted in a way that my audience can easily browse through the website and find it by clicking the right page name. I employed familiar design patterns such as a navigation bar/menu, a sidebar, and a footer to improve the familiarity of my site for my audience so that they are comfortable with browsing my website and even find things more efficiently.


## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs about a paragraph. Sketches can often help tell the story of your design.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

The intended audience of my site are vendors looking to participate in the Apple Harvest festival. This audience will visit the Apple Harvest Festival website in order to find information to register as a vendor, as well as other, more general information on the Apple Harvest festival. This audience shares the goal of selling things at the festival, and of needing to register as a vendor for Apple fest which is not a goal that another audience, such as Ithaca residents interested in visiting the festival have.

### Audience Goals
> Explain how your site's design addresses the goals of the audience.

My site's design addresses my audience's goal of finding vendor registration information by making vendor registration information easy to find with a link on the navigation bar/menu labeled vendor registration that links to the desired information. Additionally, to address the audience's goal of registering as a vendor for the festival, on the vendor registration page is a button that links to the registration form. The button is emphasized with contrasting color making it easy for the user to find. Lastly, to address the audience goal of finding additional important information about the fair (such as time, location, date), that other information is included as content on the site. They are also sorted into pages and linked on the navigation bar/menu which makes searching for a specific piece of information (e.g. parking) easier to find.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final design is appropriate for your audience.
> Include design patterns in your rationale.

This final design is appropriate for my audience because it is able to address all of the audience's goals. It includes all of the content that potential Apple Harvest vendors would need to find, including vendor registration information, a link to the registration form, and other general, important information (e.g. time, location, directions, a map) they might need to participate in the Apple Harvest Festival. Additionally, the footer has contact information for the Downtown Ithaca Alliance if the user has additional questions about the Festival. The site's pages are sorted in a way that makes it easy for the audience to find specific content as the content is grouped by subject.

The layout of the website is also appropriate for the audience, as it is a familiar website layout with a sidebar on the wide version of the website, a header, a navigation bar/menu (depending on wide or narrow view), and a footer. Using a familiar website layout prevents the user from being confused as they look for their desired information. Lastly, the theme of the website is appropriate for the audience and for the Apple Harvest Festival because the colors of the website give a rustic feeling that matches the festival.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

While completing this project I learned how to create a flexible, accessible website that can adapt to the user's screen size and device constraints. This is a useful skill because it guarantees accessibility to all of the users of my website, which is crucial for a designer when designing with the audience in mind. On the technical side, I learned how to use flex boxes and media queries to implement responsive user design.
